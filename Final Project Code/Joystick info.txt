To find a simple and easy way to move robot, we will use this formula

Percentage for one axis = (Current Value) - (Min Value) / (Max Value) - (Min Value)

There are 4 quadrants
	Up
	Down
	Left
	Right

Need to read X and Y value from joystick, Determine quadrant, apply formula, then send through hex.

Maybe instead of sending thousands of possible value, we have 10 or so for each direction?

do math on joystick, then send to main robot

analog values ranging from 0 to 1023.

Dont know how to handle yet how to stop robot

First implementation:
	Each direction of analog joy stick is going to correlate with a 100% motor in that direction
	Analog goes from 0 to 1023
	Aprox middle point is ~510
	I.E
		Left is x 0, y in middle
		Right is x 1023, y in middle
		Up is x in middle, y 1023
		Down is x in middle, y 0
	For sending over IR in this implementation, we will use address hex for x and command for y
	
	We need to define a hex value for each state
		one for 0
		one for 1023 
		on each axis
	4 commands for each state possible state of motors
	0x00 = motor 1 and motor 2 forward
	0x01 = motor 1 and motor 2 backwards
	0x02 = motor 1 forwards and motor 2 backwards
	0x03 = motor 1 backwards and motor 2 forward
